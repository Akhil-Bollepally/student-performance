# 🎓 Student Academic Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Academic performance prediction helps students and institutions understand how study habits, behavioral patterns, and academic trends impact CGPA outcomes.

This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to predict a student’s **CGPA** based on academic inputs and behavioral factors.  
The trained model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.
